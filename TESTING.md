Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. i took help from the Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as i was building the website.

I have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

* [Index Page] ( Pass - Checked the "index.html" using https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea )
* [Menu Page] ( Pass - Checked the "menus.html" using https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea )
* [Index Page] ( Pass - Checked the "findus.html" using https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea )
* [Style.css] ( Pass . Checked the "style.css" using https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)

## Lighthouse

My Lighthouse score were really good for accessability. The performance was not so great so i will try to improve on that part.
