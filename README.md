# PIZZERIA PALERMO

"Welcome to Palermo Pizzeria, your go-to destination for authentic Italian-style pizzas in the heart of Montreal. 
This project aims to provide customers with a taste of Italy through a variety of classical, meat, vegetarian, and seafood pizzas. 
I built this website so that the whole world could take part of this wonderful pizzeria.


Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the website came with inspiration from the colors of the italian flag. The cream colors fit in well with the theme and they kind of came to me right away as i was imagining the completed website in my head.

### Typography

I used the standard font style for the majority of the site.

For the footer i chose the "Arial" font family, specifically for the text next to the social media links.

Font Awesome was used to make the icons for the social medias in the footer.

## Features

The website is built up by 3 pages in total. The home menu that holds some history of the start of Palermo Pizzeria and it's owner Guiseppe Fontana. The menu page where all the pizzas and their respective toppings are showcased. And lasty a contact and find us page where you can book a reservation, ask questions and get directions to the pizzeria.

Each page has the phone number for the pizzeria in it's header.
Each page also has a nav bar that's easily useable.

### Home Page

The home page has a text container where all the history about the restaurant and it's owner is contained.
The page is responsive and adapts after screen size.

### Menu Page

The menu page is built up of four different div blocks that are responsive to the screen size. It starts with 2 menus per row and as the screen size shrinks, it goes down to showing only 1 menu and it stacks in columns instead.
It has four ordered lists, one in each div, with all the different options in them. 
Each list item has a paragraph nested inside them where the toppings are added.
There is a "Back to the top" button at the bottom that is nested inside an anchor with the #top href.

### Contact Page

The contact page consists of two different div blocks with a container nested inside them.
The first container one holds a table with the opening hours and also a form where you can send reservation requests and questions.
The second container holds the iframe with the location of the restaurant.
There is a "Back to the top" button at the bottom that is nested inside an anchor with the #top href.

### Future Implementations

- Adding prices to the pizzas
- Adding images of the pizzas
- Making the home page a bit more welcoming. Add some photos of the restaurant and of Guiseppe.
- Implement a order feature for pickups.
- Create logins with order histories.

### Accessibility

I have tried to ensure the site has been made as accessible as possible by:

- Using semantic HTML such as section, header, footer, main, etc.
- Using alt attributes on images where available.
- Using colours that are easy on the eye and fits in well together.
