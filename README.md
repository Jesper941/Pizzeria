1. i started by making a base for an HTML document with a few added features such as metadata for "keywords" and "description". 
i also created the base for my header and navbar.

2. I finished my header and styled it to my liking. 
I used "https://www.w3schools.com/" for help when styling the .text-container part so that the transparent container with my header text would look great.


3. i did some inline styling on the navbar to give the different links different colors.
I used this website to learn how to do it properly: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10143357/how-to-make-these-buttons-not-appear-as-blue-links

4. i added some text-stroke to the paragraph to give it some more depth
i learned it here: https://css-tricks.com/adding-stroke-to-web-text/

5. i fixed the styling in style.css due to a problem with the text container piling up on the navbar because i was using an absoute position on the text container. Problem is now solved

6. I added lists to the "menus.html" file and i have started filling in the lists with pizzas.
I also added CSS styling for the menu blocks for more accessability.

"https://fontawesome.com/icons"

changed button CSS to be more responsive to the screen size

i've been sitting for over 2 hours revamping the CSS styling to make everything more responsive to screen sizes by adjusting width &, margins and i even added different stylings for smaller screen sizes using the @media screen and max(width) element.
